# GDP components over time and among countries

At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). You can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the [Wikipedia GDP page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product).

The GDP data we will look at is from the [United Nations' National Accounts Main Aggregates Database](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads), which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country's GDP. The file we will work with is [GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6) and it has already been saved in the Data directory. Have a look at the Excel file to see how it is structured and organised


```{r read_GDP_data}

UN_GDP_data  <-  read_excel(here::here("data", "Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xls"), # Excel filename
                sheet="Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr", # Sheet name
                skip=2) # Number of rows to skip

```

 The first thing you need to do is to tidy the data, as it is in wide format and you must make it into long, tidy format. Please express all figures in billions (divide values by `1e9`, or $10^9$), and you want to rename the indicators into something shorter.


```{r reshape_GDP_data}

tidy_GDP_data = UN_GDP_data %>%
  select(1:51) %>% 
      pivot_longer(cols=4:51,
      names_to="year",
      values_to = "value") %>%
  mutate(value = value / 1000000000)

glimpse(tidy_GDP_data)


# Let us compare GDP components for these 3 countries
country_list <- c("United States","India", "Germany")
```

First, can you produce this plot?


```{r gdp1, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "gdp1.png"), error = FALSE)
```



```{r}
indicatorname_list = c("Gross capital formation", 
                   "Exports of goods and services", 
                   "General government final consumption expenditure", 
                   "Household consumption expenditure (including Non-profit institutions serving households)", 
                   "Imports of goods and services")


tidy_GDP_data %>%
  filter(Country %in% country_list)%>%
  filter(IndicatorName %in% indicatorname_list)%>%
  group_by(IndicatorName)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=years, y=value, color=IndicatorName, group=IndicatorName))+
  geom_line(aes(x=year, y=value, color=IndicatorName))+
  facet_wrap(~ Country)+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.position="bottom", 
        legend.direction="vertical")+
  scale_x_discrete(breaks=seq(1970, 2017, 10))+ #break the years as indicated in the plot
  labs(title = "GDP components over time",
         subtitle = "In constant 2010 USD",
         x = "", 
         y = "Billion US$")+
  scale_shape_discrete(
    limits = c(
      "Gross capital formation", 
      "Exports of goods and services", 
      "General government final consumption expenditure", 
      "Household consumption expenditure (including Non-profit institutions serving households)", 
      "Imports of goods and services"),
    labels = c(
      "Gross capital formation", 
      "Exports", 
      "Government expenditure",
      "Household expenditure", 
      "Imports"))
  NULL
```


Secondly, recall that GDP is the sum of Household Expenditure (Consumption *C*), Gross Capital Formation (business investment *I*), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports). Even though there is an indicator `Gross Domestic Product (GDP)` in your dataframe, I would like you to calculate it given its components discussed above.


```{r gdp2, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "gdp2.png"), error = FALSE)
```


```{r}

tidy_GDP_data = tidy_GDP_data %>%
  select(1:5) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = IndicatorName, values_from = value)


# glimpse(tidy_GDP_data)

```

```{r recalucate GDP}

tidy_GDP_data_new <- tidy_GDP_data %>% 
  mutate(net_exports = tidy_GDP_data$`Exports of goods and services`
           - tidy_GDP_data$`Imports of goods and services`) %>% 
  mutate(calculated_GDP = 
           tidy_GDP_data$`Household consumption expenditure (including Non-profit institutions serving households)`
           + tidy_GDP_data$`Gross capital formation` 
           + tidy_GDP_data$`General government final consumption expenditure`
           + tidy_GDP_data$`Exports of goods and services`
           - tidy_GDP_data$`Imports of goods and services`) %>% 

  # calculate proportion of each to Total Value Added
  mutate(G_proportion = (tidy_GDP_data$`General government final consumption expenditure`/tidy_GDP_data$`Total Value Added`)*100) %>% 
  mutate(I_proportion = (tidy_GDP_data$`Gross capital formation`/tidy_GDP_data$`Total Value Added`)*100) %>% 
  mutate(C_proportion = (tidy_GDP_data$`Household consumption expenditure (including Non-profit institutions serving households)`/tidy_GDP_data$`Total Value Added`)*100) %>% 
  # recalculate percentage differences
  mutate(perc_difference = ((calculated_GDP/tidy_GDP_data$`Gross Domestic Product (GDP)`)-1)*100)
  
```

```{r reproduce gdp2}

library(formattable)

tidy_GDP_proportion <- select(tidy_GDP_data_new, c("Country","year","G_proportion","I_proportion","C_proportion"))

tidy_GDP_proportion_long <- tidy_GDP_proportion %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = 3:5, names_to = "type", values_to = "proportion_percentage") 
  

tidy_GDP_proportion_long %>%
  filter(Country %in% country_list) %>%
  group_by(type) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=proportion_percentage, color=type, group=type))+
  geom_line(aes(x=year, y=proportion_percentage, color=type))+
  facet_wrap(~ Country)+

         y = "proportion")+
  NULL

> What is this last chart telling you? Can you explain in a couple of paragraphs the different dynamic among these three countries? 

In terms of GDP components over time, all three countries show similar increasing trends from the year of 1970 to 2020 onwards. For all of three countries, household expenditures are always higher than rest of GDP components, this can also be an evidence that people are spending more and living a better life as time passes. Or on the other hand, inflation is increasing steadily in general as year goes. 

From the perspectives of each country, Germany the magnitude of increases in trends is not as large as US, but still higher than India. This might relates to the country status - developing countries such as India has lower growth rates whereas developed countries such as the US has the highest growth rate. Notice that the government expenditure at US is much higher than the rest of two countries, which we believe is one of the reasons that the increasing magnitudes for all other GDP components at US are the highest compared to other countries.

In terms of the second plot - GDP and its breakdown, it has pretty much verified our above findings. House expenditures for all three countries account for the greatest part of GDP. Further, we could see that net exports have the lowest proportion, similar for all three countires. In general, the proportions for each GDP stay relatively stable, independent of changes of total changes of GDP.
